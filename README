= selfmodifier portal

This is a portal to github, which can record projects owned by several individuals.  It is intended to be used by a group of hackers who want a page listing all their software.

It is like a github badge but is geared towards an organisation, rather than one person.

This project is *CLEARLY NOT FINISHED*, hence:
* The instructions below are for running the site in development mode.
* You will notice that the haml templates are hard-wired for an organisation called selfmodifier.org.
* Your development environment would probably have to be pretty similar to mine.
